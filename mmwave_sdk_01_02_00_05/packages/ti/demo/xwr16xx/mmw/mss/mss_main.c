/** @mainpage Millimeter Wave (mmw) Demo for XWR16XX
 *
 *  @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 *  @image html toplevel.png
 *
 *  The millimeter wave demo shows some of the capabilities of the XWR16xx SoC
 *  using the drivers in the mmWave SDK (Software Development Kit).
 *  It allows user to specify the chirping profile and displays the detected
 *  objects and other information in real-time.
 *
 *  Following is a high level description of the features of this demo:
 *  - Be able to specify desired chirping profile through command line interface (CLI) 
 *    on a UART port or through the TI Gallery App - **mmWave Demo Visualizer** - 
 *    that allows user to provide a variety of profile configurations via the UART input port 
 *    and displays the streamed detected output from another UART port in real-time, 
 *    as seen in picture above.
 *  - Some sample profile configurations have been provided in the demo directory that can be
 *    used with CLI directly or via **mmWave Demo Visualizer**:
 *    @verbatim
        mmw/profiles/profile_2d.cfg
        mmw/profiles/profile_2d_srr.cfg
        mmw/profiles/profile_heat_map.cfg
      @endverbatim
 *  - Do 1D, 2D, CFAR and Azimuth processing and stream out velocity
 *    and two spatial coordinates (x,y) of the detected objects in real-time.
 *    The demo can also be configured to do 2D only detection (velocity and x,y coordinates).
 *  - Various display options besides object detection like azimuth heat map and
 *    Doppler-range heat map.
 *  - Illustrates how to configure the various hardware entities (
 *    EDMA, UART) in the AR SoC using the driver software.
 *
 *  @section limit Limitations
 *  
 *  - Because of UART speed limit (< 1 Mbps), the frame time is more restrictive.
 *    For example, for the azimuth and Doppler heat maps for 256 FFT range and
 *    16 point FFT Doppler, it takes about 200 ms to transmit.
 *  - Present implementation in this demo can resolve up to two objects in the azimuth
 *    dimension which have the same range and same velocity. 
 *  - Code will give an error if the requested memory in L3 RAM exceeds its size
 *   (@ref SOC_XWR16XX_DSS_L3RAM_SIZE) due to particular combination  of CLI configuration parameters.
 *  - For most boards, a range bias of few centimeters has been observed. User can estimate
 *    the range bias on their board and correct using the calibration procedure
 *    described in @ref calibration.
 *  
 *  @section tasks System Details
 *  The millimeter wave demo runs on both R4F (MSS) and C674x (DSS).
 *  System startup is described in the following diagram:
 *
 *  @image html system_startup.png "System Startup"
 *
 *
 *  @subsection mss_tasks Software Tasks on MSS
 *    The following (SYSBIOS) tasks are running on MSS:
 *     - @ref MmwDemo_mssInitTask. This task is created and launched by @ref main and is a
 *       one-time initialization  task that performs the following sequence:
 *       -# Initializes drivers (\<driver\>_init).
 *       -# Initializes the MMWave module (MMWave_init)
 *       -# Creates/launches the following tasks (the @ref CLI_task is launched indirectly by 
 *          calling @ref CLI_open).
 *     - @ref MmwDemo_mmWaveCtrlTask. This task is used to provide an execution context 
 *        for the mmWave control, it calls in an endless loop the MMWave_execute API.
 *     - @ref MmwDemo_mssCtrlPathTask. The task is used to process data path events coming
 *       from the @ref CLI_task or start/stop events coming from @ref SOC_XWR16XX_GPIO_1 button on 
 *       EVM. It signals the start/stop completion events back to @ref CLI_task.
 *     - @ref CLI_task. This CLI task takes user commands and posts events to the @ref MmwDemo_mssCtrlPathTask.
 *       In case of start/stop commands, it waits for the completion events from @ref MmwDemo_mssCtrlPathTask and
 *       on success, it toggles the LED @ref SOC_XWR16XX_GPIO_2.
 *     - @ref MmwDemo_mboxReadTask. This task handles mailbox messages received from DSS.
 *
 *  @subsection dss_tasks Software Tasks on DSS
 *
 *  The following four (SYSBIOS) tasks are running on DSS:
 *    - @ref MmwDemo_dssInitTask. This task is created/launched by main (in dss_main.c) and is a
 *      one-time active task that performs the following sequence:
 *      -# Initializes drivers (\<driver\>_init).
 *      -# Initializes the MMWave module (MMWave_init)
 *      -# Creates/launches the other three tasks.
 *    - @ref MmwDemo_mboxReadTask. This task handles mailbox messages received from MSS.
 *    - @ref MmwDemo_dssMMWaveCtrlTask. This task is used to provide an execution
 *      context for the mmWave control, it calls in an endless loop the MMWave_execute API.
 *    - @ref MmwDemo_dssDataPathTask. The task performs in real-time:
 *      - Data path processing chain control and (re-)configuration 
 *        of the hardware entities involved in the processing chain, namely EDMA.
 *      - Data path signal processing such as range, Doppler and azimuth DFT,
 *        object detection, and direction of arrival calculation.
 *      - Transfers detected objects to the HS-RAM shared memory and informs MSS that the data
 *        is ready to be sent out to through the UART output port.
 *        For format of the data on UART output port, see @ref MmwDemo_dssSendProcessOutputToMSS.
 *        The UART transmission is done on MSS.
 *
 *      The task pends on the following events:
 *      - @ref MMWDEMO_CONFIG_EVT. This event is posted by @ref MmwDemo_dssMmwaveConfigCallbackFxn
 *        which in called by MMWAVE_ API triggered when MSS issues MMWAVE_config
 *      - @ref MMWDEMO_BSS_STOP_COMPLETE_EVT. This event is posted by @ref MmwDemo_dssMmwaveEventCallbackFxn when 
 *        the Frame Stop asynchronous event is received. Details as follows:
 *        Initially MSS receives the CLI sensorStop command and issues a stop command to BSS. 
 *        Once BSS fully stops the frame processing, BSS sends a "Frame Stopped Asynchronous event" to MSS. 
 *        MSS then forwards the "Frame Stopped Asynchronous event" to DSS, where
 *        it is handled by @ref MmwDemo_dssMmwaveEventCallbackFxn.
 *        This event causes DSS to go in @ref MmwDemo_DSS_STATE_STOP_PENDING state.
 *        If DSS received the "Frame Stopped Asynchronous event" after the inter-frame processing is completed, 
 *        it will post MMWDEMO_STOP_COMPLETE_EVT. 
 *        Otherwise, it will wait to finish the inter-frame processing before posting MMWDEMO_STOP_COMPLETE_EVT.
 *        See MMWDEMO_STOP_COMPLETE_EVT event below for more details.
 *      - @ref MMWDEMO_FRAMESTART_EVT. This event originates from BSS firmware
 *        and indicates the beginning of the radar frame. It is posted by interrupt
 *        handler function @ref MmwDemo_dssFrameStartIntHandler.
 *      - @ref MMWDEMO_CHIRP_EVT. This event originates from BSS firmware and
 *        indicates that the ADC buffer, (ping or pong) is filled with ADC samples.
 *        It is posted by @ref MmwDemo_dssChirpIntHandler.
 *      - @ref MMWDEMO_START_EVT. This event is posted by @ref MmwDemo_dssMmwaveStartCallbackFxn when 
 *        MMWave_start is called from MSS (on CLI sensorStart 0 command which means starts with
 *        no reconfiguration)
 *      - @ref MMWDEMO_STOP_COMPLETE_EVT. This event is posted either when the MMWDEMO_BSS_STOP_COMPLETE_EVT
 *        is received after the inter-frame processing has ended or when the ongoing active frame finishes sending data over UART.
 *        This event now moves the DSS to MmwDemo_DSS_STATE_STOP state and executes @ref MmwDemo_dssDataPathStop
 *        which further sends @ref MMWDEMO_DSS2MSS_STOPDONE message back to MSS.

 *  @section datapathtop Data Path
 *  @subsection datapath Data Path - Overall
 *   @image html datapath_overall.png "Top Level Data Path Processing Chain"
 *   \n
 *   \n
 *   @image html datapath_overall_timing.png "Top Level Data Path Timing"
 *    
 *   As seen in the above picture, the data path processing consists of:
 *   - Processing during the chirps as seen in the timing diagram. This
 *     consists of
 *     - 1D (range) FFT processing performed by C674x that takes input from
 *       multiple receive antennas from the ADC buffer for every some number of chirps
 *       (corresponding to the chirping pattern on the transmit antennas), and
 *     - transferring output into the L3 RAM by EDMA. More details
 *       can be seen in @ref data1d
 *   - Processing during the idle or cool down period of the RF circuitry following the chirps 
 *     until the next chirping period, shown as "Inter frame processing time" in the timing diagram. 
 *     This processing consists of:
 *     - 2D (velocity) FFT processing performed by C674x that reads input from 1D output in L3 RAM in a 
 *       transposed manner (using EDMA) and performs
 *       FFT to give a (range,velocity) matrix in the L3 RAM. The processing also includes the CFAR detection in Doppler direction.
 *       More details can be seen in @ref data2d.
 *     - CFAR detection in range direction using mmWave library.
 *     - Peak Grouping if enabled.
 *     - Direction of Arrival (Azimuth) Estimation. More details can be seen at
 *       @ref dataAngElev and @ref dataXYZ
 *  @subsubsection advanced Advanced Frame - Sub Frame Processing
 *   @image html datapath_overall_timing_subframe.png "Top Level Data Path Timing for sub-frames"
 *   \n
 *   \n
 *   In advanced frame mode, sub-frame processing is supported for which the datapath
 *   is essentially same as described in @ref datapath except that there is sub-frame switching
 *   related processing required to prepare for next sub-frame as seen in above diagram. The details
 *   of what is involved in sub-frame switching are described in @ref subFrameSwitching.
 *   The data path for each sub-frame is independent of other sub-frames i.e there is no
 *   combining of information across sub-frames - each sub-frame's results are sent out
 *   to the host after the completion of its data path processing in real-time.
 *
 *  @subsection antConfig Antenna Configurations
 *  The following figure shows antenna layout as seen from the front of
 *  the EVM xWR16xx board alongside the x,y coordinate convention.
 *   @image html antenna_design.png "AWR16xx Antenna layout"
 *
 *   As seen in figures below, the millimeter wave demo supports two antenna configurations:
 *     - Single transmit antenna and four receive antennas.
 *     - Two transmit antennas and four receive antennas. Transmit antennas Tx1 and Tx2
 *       are horizontally spaced at d = 2 Lambda, with their transmissions interleaved in
 *       a frame
 *   @image html antenna_layout_simo.png "Single Tx Antenna Configuration"
 *   \n
 *   @image html antenna_layout_mimo.png "TDM-MIMO Antenna Configuration"
 *   \n
 *
 *    Both configurations allow for azimuth estimation.
 *
 *   @subsection data1d Data Path - 1st Dimension FFT Processing
 *   @image html datapath_1d_tdm_mimo.png "Data Path 1D for TDM-MIMO configuration"
 *   \n
 *
 *   Above picture illustrates 1D chirp processing for the case with one chirp (interrupt) event
 *   for every two chirps and two
 *   transmit antennas, (TDM-MIMO case), as mentioned in @ref antConfig.
 *   There are 4 rx antennas, the samples of which are color-coded and labeled
 *   as 1,2,3,4 with unique coloring for each of chirps that are processed
 *   in ping-pong manner. The 1D FFT chirp processing is triggered by 
 *   hardware chirp event generated when the ADC
 *   has samples to process in the ADC buffer Ping or Pong memories. The hardware event
 *   triggers the registered chirp event interrupt handler function @ref MmwDemo_dssChirpIntHandler,
 *   that in turn posts @ref MMWDEMO_CHIRP_EVT to @ref MmwDemo_dssDataPathTask. The task initiates EDMA
 *   transfer of rx antenna samples in a ping pong manner to parallelize C674x processing
 *   with EDMA data transfer from ADC buffer to L2 memory.
 *   The processing includes FFT calculation using DSP library function with
 *   16-bit input and output precision. Before FFT calculation, a Blackman window
 *   is applied to ADC samples using mmwlib library function. The calculated 1D
 *   FFT samples are EDMA transferred to the radar cube
 *   matrix in L3 memory. One column of the radar cube matrix contains 1D-FFT
 *   samples of chirps corresponding to the two transmit antennas and in this (TDM) case, 
 *   all chirps corresponding to Tx1 are stored consecutively followed by those corresponding
 *   to Tx2. The reason for storing in this way instead of time of arrival order (Tx1,Tx2,Tx1,Tx2..)
 *   is to prevent EDMA jump for 1D output and 2D input from exceeding the EDMA jump limit.
 *   The EDMA jumps (source and destination B/C indices) are 16-bit signed, so when 
 *   number of range bins is 1024 and number of receive antennas is 4, the jump becomes
 *   1024*4*4(bytes/sample)*2(Tx1,Tx2 order) = 32768 which is -32768 as signed 16-bit.
 *   While the jump in 1D output can be overcome by setting the destination address in the compute
 *   loop every chirp output EDMA trigger (which is not too significant burden in cycles),
 *   the 2D cannot be overcome this way without breaking the very purpose of EDMA-CPU parallelism
 *   because the source address would have to be reprogrammed every sample!
 *   The jump is halved (16384) when storing all Tx1 consecutively followed by all Tx2 consecutively.
 *   Picture below illustrates the shape of radar cube matrix
 *   for one Tx antenna configuration, where one column contains 1D FFT samples of one chirp.
 *
 *   @image html datapath_1d_simo_radar_cube.png "Radar cube matrix for single Tx antenna configuration"
 *   \n
 *
 *   The timing diagram of chirp processing is illustrated in figure below.
 *   @image html datapath_1d_timing.png "Data Path 1D timing diagram"

 *
 *  @subsubsection calibDC_Range Antenna coupling signature removal
 *
 *    @image html antenna_coupling_signature_removal.png "Antenna coupling signature removal"
 *
 *  Antenna coupling signature dominates the range bins close to the radar.
 *  These are the bins in the range FFT output located around DC.
 *  This feature is under user control in terms of
 *  enable/disable and start/end range bins through a CLI command called calibDcRangeSig.
 *  During measurement (when the CLI command is issued with feature enabled),
 *  each of the specified range bins for each of the virtual antennas are accumulated
 *  over the specified number of chirps and at the end of the period, the average
 *  is computed for each bin/antenna combination for removal after the measurement
 *  period is over. Note that the number of chirps to average must be power of 2.
 *  It is assumed that no objects are present
 *  in the vicinity of the radar during this measurement period. After measurement
 *  is done, the removal starts for all subsequent frames during which each
 *  of the bin/antenna average estimate is subtracted from the corresponding received samples
 *  in real-time for subsequent processing.
 *
 *  @subsection data2d Data Path - 2nd Dimension FFT Processing
 *   The 2D processing consists of the following steps:
 *   -# For each range bin it performs:
 *     - Static clutter removal if enabled. The mean value of the input samples to the
 *       2D-FFT is subtracted from the samples,
 *     - Windowing - samples are multiplied by a window function,
 *     - 2D-FFT on the samples of 1D-FFT output across chirps (samples are transposed
 *       by the EDMA before 2D FFT can be performed),
 *     - log2 magnitude of the output,
 *     - accumulation across all Rx antennas,
 *     - transfer of accumulated values to detection matrix in L3 using EDMA,
 *     - CFAR pre-detection in Doppler direction and saving of Doppler
 *     indices of detected objects for the final CFAR detection in the range direction.
 *   
 *   -# Final CFAR detection in range direction at Doppler indices at which
 *   objects were detected in previous step
 *   -# Peak grouping. Grouping options are specified by CLI CFAR configuration function and can be
 *     - in both range and Doppler direction,
 *     - only in range,
 *     - only in Doppler direction, or
 *     - none.
 *  \n
 *  The 2D processing is shown in figures below.
 *
 *  @image html datapath_2d_detailed_part1.png "2D-FFT Processing - Calculation of Detection Matrix and CFAR in Doppler direction"
 *  \n

 *  \n
 *  \n
 *  @image html datapath_2d_detailed_part2.png "CFAR in range direction and peak grouping"
 *
 *  @subsubsection peakGrouping Peak grouping
 *  Two peak grouping schemes are implemented:
 *  -# Peak grouping based on peaks of the neighboring bins read from detection
 *  matrix. For each CFAR detected peak, listed in @ref MmwDemo_DSS_DataPathObj::detObj2DRaw,
 *  it checks if the peak is greater than its neighbors. If this is true, the
 *  peak is copied to the output list of detected objects
 *  @ref MmwDemo_DSS_DataPathObj::detObj2D. The neighboring peaks that are used
 *  for checking are taken from the detection matrix @ref MmwDemo_DSS_DataPathObj::detMatrix
 *  and are copied into 3x3 kernel regardless of whether they are CFAR detected or not.
 *  -# Peak grouping based on peaks of neighboring bins that are CFAR detected.
 *  For each detected peak the function checks if the peak is greater than its
 *  neighbors. If this is true, the peak is copied to the output list of
 *  detected objects. The neighboring peaks that are used for checking are
 *  taken from the list of CFAR detected objects, (not from the detection matrix),
 *  and are copied into 3x3 kernel that has been initialized to zero for each
 *  peak under test. If the neighboring peak has not been detected by CFAR,
 *  it is not copied into the kernel.
 *
 *  Peak grouping schemes are illustrated in two figures below. The first figure,
 *  illustrating the first scheme, shows how the two targets (out of four) can
 *  be discarded and not presented to the output. For these two targets (at range
 *  indices 3 and 17 in figure below) the CFAR detector did not detect the highest
 *  peak of the target, but only some on the side, and these side peaks are discarded.
 *  The second figure, illustrating the second scheme, shows that all four targets
 *  are presented to the output, one peak per target, with the targets at range
 *  indices 3 and 17 represented with side peaks.
 *

 *  @image html peak_grouping_based_on_cfar_detected_peaks.png "Peak grouping based on on neighboring CFAR detected peaks"
 *  \n
 *  @subsection dataAngElev Data Path - Direction of Arrival FFT Calculation
 *  Because L3 memory is limited in size, the radar cube matrix stores only the
 *  1D-FFT in 16-bit precision. Because of this, azimuth FFT calculation requires
 *  repeated 2D FFT calculation. Since for each detected object, we need 2D FFT at a
 *  single bin, instead of recalculating 2D-FFT, we calculate single point DFT
 *  at the bin index of each detected object. This calculation is repeated for each received antenna.
 *
 *  Compensation for the Doppler phase shift in the angle estimation is performed on the virtual
 *  antennas (symbols corresponding to the second Tx antenna in case of TDM-MIMO
 *  configuration). These symbols are rotated by half of the estimated Doppler
 *  phase shift between subsequent chirps from the same Tx antenna.
 *  The Doppler shift is calculated using the lookup table @ref MmwDemo_DSS_DataPathObj::azimuthModCoefs
 *  Refer to the pictures below.
 *    @anchor Figure_doppler
 *    @image html angle_doppler_compensation_awr16.png "Figure_doppler: Doppler Compensation"
 *
 *  Currently the size of Azimuth FFT is hardcoded and defined by @ref MMW_NUM_ANGLE_BINS.
 *  The FFT is calculated using DSP lib function DSP_fft32x32. The output of the
 *  function is magnitude squared and the values are stored in floating point format.
 *
 *  @image html datapath_azimuth_fft.png "Direction of arrival calculation"
 *
 *
 *  @subsection dataXYZ Data Path - (X,Y) Estimation
 *    The (x,y) estimation is calculated in the function @ref MmwDemo_XYestimation.
 *    \anchor Figure_geometry
 *    @image html coordinate_geometry.png "Figure A: Coordinate Geometry"
 *    \n
 *    \anchor Figure_wx
 *    @image html coordinate_geometry_wx.png "Figure wx"
 *    \ref Figure_geometry shows orientation of x,y axes with respect to the sensor/antenna positions.
 *    The objective is to estimate the (x,y) coordinates of each detected object.
 *    \f$w_x\f$ is the phase difference between consecutive receive azimuth antennas of the 2D FFT.
 *    The phases for each antenna are shown in the \ref Figure_doppler.
 *    \ref Figure_wx shows that the distance AB which represents the relative
 *    distance between wavefronts intersecting consecutive azimuth
 *    antennas is \f$AB = \frac{\lambda}{2} \sin (\theta)\f$.
 *    Therefore \f$w_x = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \cdot AB\f$, and therefore \f$w_x = \pi \sin (\theta)\f$.
 *    Note that the phase of the left-ward antenna is advanced compared to the right-ward
 *    antenna and antenna indices increment from right to left (which is the order in ADCbuf and all
 *    of processing) so phase increments as \f$+w_x\f$.
 *    For a single obstacle, the signal at the 8 azimuth antennas will be (\f$A_1\f$ and \f$\psi\f$ are the arbitrary starting
 *    amplitude/phase at the first antenna):
 *    \f[
 *    A_1 e^{j\psi} [ 1 \; e^{jw_x} \; e^{j2w_x} \; e^{j3w_x} \; e^{j4w_x} \; e^{j5w_x} \; e^{j6w_x} \; e^{j7w_x} ]
 *    \f]
 *
 *    An FFT of the above signal will yield a peak  at \f$w_x\f$ .
 *    If \f$k_{MAX}\f$ is the index of the peak in log magnitude FFT represented as
 *    signed index in range \f$[-\frac{N}{2}, \frac{N}{2}-1]\f$, then \f$ w_x \f$ will be
 *       \f[
 *            w_x = \frac{2\pi}{N}k_{MAX}
 *       \f]
 *
 *    Calculate range (in meters) as:
 *       \f[
 *           R=k_r\frac{c \cdot F_{SAMP}}{2 \cdot S \cdot N_{FFT}}
 *       \f]
 *       where, \f$c\f$ is the speed of light (m/sec), \f$k_r\f$ is range index,
 *       \f$F_{SAMP}\f$ is the sampling frequency (Hz),
 *       \f$S\f$ is chirp slope (Hz/sec), \f$N_{FFT}\f$ is 1D FFT size.
 *    Based on above calculations of \f$R\f$ and \f$w_x\f$, the \f$(x,y)\f$ position of the object
 *    can be calculated as seen in the \ref Figure_geometry,
 *       \f[
 *           x = R\sin(\theta) = R\frac{w_x}{\pi}, y = \sqrt{R^2-x^2}
 *       \f]
 *    The computed \f$(x,y)\f$ and azimuth peak for each object are populated in their
 *    respective positions in @ref MmwDemo_DSS_DataPathObj::detObj2D. Note the azimuth
 *    peak (magnitude squared) replaces the previous CFAR peak (sum of log magnitudes) in the structure.
 *    To be able to detect two objects at the same range-doppler index but at different angle,
 *    search for the 2nd peak in the azimuth FFT and compare its height relative to the first peak height,
 *    and if detected, create new object in the list with the same range/Doppler
 *    indices, and repeat above steps to calculate (x,y) coordinates. To enable/disable
 *    the two peak detection or to change the threshold for detection, refer to
 *    @ref MMWDEMO_AZIMUTH_TWO_PEAK_DETECTION_ENABLE and @ref MMWDEMO_AZIMUTH_TWO_PEAK_THRESHOLD_SCALE.
 *
 *  @subsection velocityDisambiguation Velocity disambiguation
 *  A simple technique for velocity disambiguation is implemented. It corrects target velocities up to \f$2v_{max}\f$, and
 *  allows for correct calculation of X/Y coordinates for target velocities even greater than \f$2v_{max}\f$.
 *  The technique consists of the following steps applied after the CFAR detection phase.
 *  For each detected point, assuming doppler correction of virtual antennas is already done:
 *  -# Copy the doppler corrected antenna data A into the upper address area
 *     (labeled B in the figure below) of the azimuthIn.
 *     This is done because the DSPlib FFT function overwrites the input buffer with
 *     reversed index and we would need to later compute the FFT on sign flipped symbols
 *     corresponding to Tx2.

 *  Figure below illustrates this technique on one example with a target moving from the sensor at
 *  positive azimuth angle at a speed less than Vmax (case a), and at the

 *  The symbols of the chirp n and n+1 are used for azimuth FFT calculation.
 *  The Doppler shift, the angle \f$\psi_{true}\f$ between chirps n and n+2, (successive chirps of the same Tx antenna),
 *  is estimated from 2D-FFT as \f$\psi_{est}\f$. In case a, \f$\psi_{true} < \pi\f$,
 *  and \f$\psi_{est} \approx \psi_{true}\f$. In case b, \f$\psi_{true} > \pi\f$, (Doppler velocity is aliased),
 *  and \f$\psi_{est}\f$ is estimated as a negative value, (target approaching the sensor). Doppler compensation rotates the symbols of chirp n+1
 *  by \f$-\psi_{est}/2\f$ to align them with the symbols of chirp n. The azimuth FFT is calculated on these symbols,
 *  and the output is placed to set 0. The symbols of the chirp n+1 are then sign flipped,
 *  and the azimuth FFT is again calculated and the output is placed to set 1.
 *  In case a, V<Vmax, the maximum peak in the FFT output in set 0 is larger than in set 1, as opposed in case b, V>Vmax,
 *  where the maximum peak in FFT output in set 1 is larger than in set 0.

 *  @subsection nearFieldCorrection Near Field Correction
 *   @subsubsection nearFieldProblem Problem Statement and Algorithm Description
 *    @image html near_field_geometry.png "Near Field Geometry"
 *
 *    It was assumed in @ref dataXYZ that the object was located in the far field so that
 *    the rays between the object and the multiple TX/RX antennas are parallel.
 *    However for very close by objects this assumption (of parallel lines) is not
 *    valid as seen in the above figure and can induce a significant phase error
 *    when processed using regular FFT techniques. It can be shown that:
 *     - The phase error is most pronounced in the phase difference between the
 *       path from Tx1(C)->object(O)->Rx4(D) (red lines) and Tx2(A)->object(O)->Rx1(E) (green lines).
 *       This corresponds to the phase difference between virtual antenna 4 and 5
 *     - The phase error decreases as  the range of  the object increases.
 *     - For a fixed range, the phase error is most severe for bore-sight objects
 *       and decreases to zero at grazing angles.
 *
 *    This phase error manifests in a spurious peak in the azimuth FFT which results
 *    in ghost object detection when multi object beam forming feature is enabled.
 *    In order to mitigate this error, the phase error between the physical and virtual
 *    sets of antennas needs to be corrected based on the geometry and the range at
 *    which the object has been detected. This is done in the following manner:
 *
 *    Let x be the 1x8 vector corresponding to the 8 virtual antennas.
 *    Let F denote the 64-point FFT of x; i.e F=fftshift (fft(x,64));
 *    Similarly let \f$F_1\f$ and \f$F_2\f$ denote the 64-point FFT’s of x(1:4) and x(5:8).
 *    Then it can be shown that:
 *    \f[
 *       F(k) = F_1(k) + F_2(k) e^{-j 2 \pi k 4/64}; -32 \leq k \leq 31;
 *    \f]
 *    The above equation can be modified to incorporate the effect of the near-field
 *    induced phase error (which occurs at the boundary between the virtual antennas
 *    corresponding to TX1 and TX2). The modified equation is:
 *    \f[
 *       F(k) = F_1(k) + F_2(k) e^{-j 2 \pi k 4/64} e^{- j \phi(k,r)}; -32 \leq k \leq 31;
 *    \f]
 *    where \f$\phi(k,r)\f$ is the near-field induced phase error which depends
 *    on the angle \f$k\f$ and range \f$r\f$. This quantity can be computed from the
 *    geometry in the above figure as follows:
 *
 *     \f[
 *       \triangle OBC: tx1 = \sqrt{r^2 + \overline{\rm BC}^2 - 2 r \overline{\rm BC} \cos(\pi / 2 - \theta)}
 *     \f]
 *     \f[
 *       \triangle OBA: tx2 = \sqrt{r^2 + \overline{\rm BA}^2 - 2 r \overline{\rm BA} \cos(\pi / 2 + \theta)}
 *     \f]
 *     \f[
 *       \triangle OBD: rx4 = \sqrt{r^2 + \overline{\rm BD}^2 - 2 r \overline{\rm BD} \cos(\pi / 2 - \theta)}
 *     \f]
 *     \f[
 *       \triangle OBE: rx1 = \sqrt{r^2 + \overline{\rm BE}^2 - 2 r \overline{\rm BE} \cos(\pi / 2 - \theta)}
 *     \f]
 *
 *   With \f$theta = \arcsin(2k/64)\f$, the above simplifies to:
 *
 *     \f[
 *       tx1 = \sqrt{r^2 + \overline{\rm BC}^2 - r k (\overline{\rm BC}/16)}
 *     \f]
 *     \f[
 *       tx2 = \sqrt{r^2 + \overline{\rm BA}^2 - r k(-\overline{\rm BA}/16)}
 *     \f]
 *     \f[
 *       rx4 = \sqrt{r^2 + \overline{\rm BD}^2 - r k(\overline{\rm BD}/16)}
 *     \f]
 *     \f[
 *       rx1 = \sqrt{r^2 + \overline{\rm BE}^2 - r k(\overline{\rm BE}/16)}
 *     \f]
 *
 *     Note that \f$\overline{\rm BC}\f$, \f$\overline{\rm BA}\f$,
 *     \f$\overline{\rm BD}\f$, \f$\overline{\rm BE}\f$
 *     are constants and therefore above calculations involve
 *     4*(3 multiplications + 2 additions/subtractions + square root).
 *
 *     As mentioned in @ref dataXYZ, for far field the phase difference between
 *     consecutive antennas is \f$w_x = \pi \sin(\theta)\f$. So the phase error
 *     is calculated as:
 *     \f{eqnarray*}{
 *     \phi(k,r) &=& \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} \{(tx2 + rx1) - (tx1 + rx4)\} - \pi \sin(\theta) \\
 *               &=& \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} \{(tx2 + rx1) - (tx1 + rx4)\} - \pi k / 32
 *     \f}
 *
 *    @subsubsection nearFieldImplementation Implementation Details
 *      @image html near_field.png "Near Field Implementation"
 *
 *      Referring to the figure above, for each detected point, assuming doppler correction
 *      of virtual antennas is already done:
 *      -# Copy the antenna data corresponding to Tx2 to the upper address area
 *        (labeled B in the figure) of the azimuthIn and zero-pad between
 *        A (data for Tx1) and B. The purpose of this step is to preserve the Tx2 symbols
 *        for the next computation. Compute the FFT of the first 64 samples of azimuthIn
 *        and store in lower address (Set 0 in the picture) of azimuthOut. This is the \f$F_1(k)\f$.
 *      -# Copy the Tx2 data stored at the upper address from above step into
 *         the position B shown in the lower path, which is basically restoring
 *         B back to its original position. Zero-pad the first 4 antennas (corresponding to Tx1)
 *         and zero-pad the remaining FFT input data after B. Compute the FFT of the
 *         first 64 samples of azimuthIn and store in upper address (Set 1 in the picture)
 *         of azimuthOut. This will be \f$F_2(k) e^{-j 2 \pi k 4/64}\f$.
 *      -# Apply the correction \f$e^{- j \phi(k,r)}\f$ on Set 1 over all \f$k \in [-32,31)\f$
 *         and add with Set 0 in place i.e output of the sum will replace Set 0.
 *      -# Proceed to do the rest of the azimuth calculations (magnitude square etc).
 *
 *    NOTE:
 *      -# The range bias estimated from the calibration procedure is subtracted from the
 *         range at which object is detected before calculating the phase correction.
 *        The function to estimate the phase correction is @ref MmwDemo_nearFieldCorrection.
 *      -# The near field correction is currently in exclusion with velocity disambiguation
 *         because of implementation complexities and also because it is unlikely to have
 *         objects at high velocities in the near field.
 *
 *    @subsubsection nearFieldintereface User Interface
 *
 *    A CLI command "nearFieldCfg" has been provided with parameters to enable/disable
 *    the feature and provide start and end range index over which the feature
 *    is to be activated. The phase error is highest at boresight (\f$\theta = 0\f$).
 *    The following data at the boresight, which can be computed
 *    using the formulae in @ref nearFieldProblem, can be used as a guidance to
 *    decide the maximum range up to which to enable the feature.
 *
 *    | Distance (cm) | Phase Error (degrees) |
 *    |---------------|-----------------------|
 *    | 5             | 177.8                 |
 *    | 10            | 90.3                  |
 *    | 20            | 45.3                  |
 *    | 40            | 22.7                  |
 *    | 80            | 11.4                  |
 *    | 100           | 9.1                   |
 *    | 200           | 4.5                   |
 *    | 400           | 2.3                   |
 *    | 1000          | 0.9                   |
 *
 *    NOTE:
 *    -# The range index does not exclude the range bias.
 *        E.g if the range bias is 6 cm and the range step is 2 cm,
 *        then 4 cm from the sensor will be (6+4)/2 or 5 range bins or range index of 4.
 *    -# Because of several computations involved in the near field correction
 *       for each detected point in the near field
 *       (most notably 64*(4 square root + 1 sin + 1 cosine)),
 *       the DSP will consume non-trivial MIPS for this feature.
 *       Presently it takes about 35000 cycles per detected point in the
 *       enabled near field range which is 58 us (at 600 MHz DSP speed).
 *    -# Because of reasons not yet fully understood, the feature does not work
 *       reliably below about 5 cm and therefore is recommended to be disabled below
 *       this range (using the start index parameter of the configuration).
 *    -# The near field correction is not applied on azimuth-range heatmap data
 *       shipped out of the target.

 *
 *  @subsection subFrameSwitching Sub-frame Switching for Advanced Frame
 *    There is some compute overhead for switching sub-frames beyond the book-keeping
 *    aspects for the data path object (which are multi-instantiated).
 *    Because of the potential resource constraints of EDMA (channels, params etc),
 *    and memory limitations, some computations are redone for each sub-frame depending on its
 *    configuration. These are:
 *    - Reconfiguration of ADCbuf driver - @ref MmwDemo_dssDataPathConfigAdcBuf
 *    - Reprogramming of the EDMA channels and Param sets - @ref MmwDemo_dataPathInitEdma
 *    - Regeneration of tables for FFT (twiddle tables), single-point DFT and
 *      FFT window - @ref MmwDemo_dataPathConfigFFTs. This regeneration is particularly
 *      high in cycles if not optimized so certain optimizations
 *      were performed to efficiently generation these tables.
 *
 *    One can see the cycles related to switching to the next sub-frame
 *    by examining in real-time mode
 *    the element @ref MmwDemo_timingInfo::subFrameSwitchingCycles
 *    in the data path object instance corresponding to the current sub-frame.
 *    Note that the buffer layout as described in section @ref edma is calculated during configuration
 *    time for all sub-frames corresponding to their configurations and so does not need
 *    to be part of sub-frame switching, because the memory savings related to not
 *    multiplying the buffer pointer storage for all sub-frames is modest.
 *    The above functions are called as part of a convenient reconfiguration
 *    function - @ref MmwDemo_dssDataPathReconfig.
 *
 *  @subsection output Output information sent to host
 *      Output packets with the detection information are sent out every frame
 *      through the UART. Each packet consists of the header @ref MmwDemo_output_message_header_t
 *      and the number of TLV items containing various data information with
 *      types enumerated in @ref MmwDemo_output_message_type_e. The numerical values
 *      of the types can be found in @ref mmw_output.h. Each TLV
 *      item consists of type, length (@ref MmwDemo_output_message_tl_t) and payload information.
 *      The structure of the output packet is illustrated in the following figure.
 *      Since the length of the packet depends on the number of detected objects
 *      it can vary from frame to frame. The end of the packet is padded so that
 *      the total packet length is always multiple of 32 Bytes.

 *  @subsection calibration Range Bias and Rx Channel Gain/Offset Measurement and Compensation
 *     @anchor Figure_calibration
 *     @image html rx_ch_calibration.png "Measurement and compensation of range bias and Rx channel gain/offset"
 *
 *     Because of imperfections in antenna layouts on the board, RF delays in SOC, etc,
 *     there is need to calibrate the sensor to compensate for bias in the range estimation and
 *     receive channel gain and phase imperfections. The calibration procedure is as follows:
 *
 *     -# Set a strong target like corner reflector at the distance of X meter
 *     (X less than 50 cm is not recommended) at boresight.
 *     -# Set the following command
 *     in the configuration profile in .../demo/xwr16xx/mmw/profiles/profile_calibration.cfg,
 *     to reflect the position X as follows:
 *     @verbatim
       measureRangeBiasAndRxChanPhase 1 X D
       @endverbatim
 *     where D (in meters) is the distance of window around X where the peak will be searched.
 *     The purpose of the search window is to allow the test environment from not being overly constrained 
 *     say because it may not be possible to clear it of all reflectors that may be stronger than the one used 
 *     for calibration. The window size is recommended to be at least the distance equivalent of a few range bins.
 *     One range bin for the calibration profile (profile_calibration.cfg) is about 5 cm.
 *     The first argument "1" is to enable the measurement. The stated configuration
 *     profile (.cfg) must be used otherwise the calibration may not work as expected
 *     (this profile ensures all transmit and receive antennas are engaged among
 *     other things needed for calibration).
 *     -# Start the sensor with the configuration file.
 *     -# To estimate the range bias, peak search is done after the 2D FFT in the 0th Doppler
 *     of the detection matrix. The peak position is then used to compute the
 *     square root of the sum of the magnitude squares of the virtual antennas
 *     (taken from @ref MmwDemo_DSS_DataPathObj::azimuthStaticHeatMap) for the
 *     peak and its two nearest neighbors. These 3 magnitudes and their positions
 *     are used to do parabolic interpolation to find the more accurate peak from
 *     which the range bias is estimated as peak - X.
 *     The rx channel phase and gain estimation is done by finding the minimum
 *     of the magnitude squared of the virtual antennas and this minimum is used
 *     to scale the individual antennas so that the magnitude of the coefficients is
 *     always less than or equal to 1. The complex conjugate of the samples
 *     scaled in this way is stored in a common storage area (common across sub-frames)
 *     in Q15 format (@ref MmwDemo_CliCommonCfg_t::compRxChanCfg).
 *     Refer to the function @ref MmwDemo_rangeBiasRxChPhaseMeasure
 *     which performs the measurements and as seen in the above picture, the measurement
 *     results are written out on the CLI port in the format below:
 *     @verbatim
       compRangeBiasAndRxChanPhase <rangeBias> <Re(0,0)> <Im(0,0)> <Re(0,1)> <Im(0,1)> ... <Re(0,R-1)> <Im(0,R-1)> <Re(1,0)> <Im(1,0)> ... <Re(T-1,R-1)> <Im(T-1,R-1)>
       @endverbatim
 *     -# The command printed out on the CLI now can be copied and pasted in any
 *     configuration file for correction purposes. During the parsing of the
 *     configuration file, based on the antenna profile, the measurement result stored
 *     as described in previous step in the common storage is copied to individual
 *     sub-frame data path object (each sub-frame may have separate configuration)
 *     so that all antennas enabled for that configuration are contiguous in storage
 *     as seen in the example shown in picture @ref Figure_calibration. This contiguous
 *     storage of the samples themselves as opposed to storing indices to look-up into
 *     the common (full) storage is required for computational efficiency in the DSP.
 *     that is used during angle estimation to apply the correction by multiplying
 *     the received samples with the stored conjugate numbers.
 *     If compensation is not desired,
 *     the following command should be given
 *     @verbatim
       compRangeBiasAndRxChanPhase 0.0   1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
       @endverbatim
 *     Above sets the range bias to 0 and
 *     the phase coefficients to unity so that there is no correction. Note
 *     the two commands must always be given in any configuration file, typically
 *     the measure commmand will be disabled when the correction command is the
 *     desired one.
 *
 *  @subsection bpmCfgNotes BPM Scheme
 *    Similar to TDM-MIMO, in BPM scheme a frame consists of multiple blocks, each
 *    block consisting of 2 chirp intervals. However, unlike in TDM-MIMO where only
 *    one TX antenna active per chirp interval, both Tx antennas are active in each
 *    chirp interval (see figure below).\n
 *
 *      @image html bpm_antenna_cfg.png "BPM Scheme Antenna configuration"
 *
 *    Let S1 and S2 represent chirp signals from two Tx antennas. In the first interval
 *    a combined signal Sa=S1+S2 is transmitted. Similarly in the second interval a
 *    combined signal Sb=S1-S2 is transmitted. Using the corresponding received signals,
 *    (S'a and S'b), at a specific received RX antenna, the components from the individual
 *    transmitters are separated out using S'1=(S'a+S'b)/2 and S'2=(S'a-S'b)/2.\n
 *    With simultaneous transmission on both Tx antennas the total transmitted power per
 *    chirp interval is increased, and it can be shown that this translates to an SNR 
 *    improvement of 3dB.\n

 *  @subsection bpmNotes Data Path changes for BPM
 *    When BPM is enabled the following changes are done in the data path.
 *    @subsubsection BPM_2d 2D Processing changes for BPM:
 *      In the 2D processing chain, when BPM is enabled, 
 *      Doppler compensation and BPM decoding are done after the 2D FFT. 
 *      Note that the decoded data is not stored in the radar cube, therefore
 *      BPM decoding needs to be done again (on a much smaller set of samples)
 *      during the direction of arrival computation.
 *      The following figure shows the required changes in the 2D processing.
 *      When BPM is enabled the fftOut2D buffer is doubled in size to accommodate both Pong (Tx1+Tx2)
 *      and Pong (Tx1-Tx2) so that BPM can be decoded.

 *
 *    @subsubsection BPM_3d Direction of Arrival Processing changes for BPM: 
 *      In the direction of arrival processing, when BPM is enabled,
 *      Doppler compensation and BPM decoding are done after the 2D FFT and before the azimuth FFT. 
 *      The following figure shows the required changes in the direction of arrival processing.

 *
 *  @subsection designNotes Data Path Design Notes
 *    @subsubsection cfar CFAR processing: 
 *      For most scenarios, detection along range dimension is likely to be more difficult (clutter) 
 *      than detection along the Doppler dimension. For e.g a simple detection procedure (CFAR-CA)
 *      might suffice in the Doppler dimension, while detection along range dimension
 *      might require more sophisticated algorithms (e.g. CFAR-OS, histogram based or other heuristics). 
 *      So detection along Doppler dimension first might be computationally cheaper:
 *      the first  selection algorithm is less complex, and the subsequent more sophisticated
 *      algorithm runs only on the points detected by the first algorithm. So in this implementation,
 *      we run Doppler CFAR first and then run range CFAR on the detected Doppler indices. However,
 *      we currently use the same type of algorithm (CFAR-CA) for the range direction as the Doppler direction.
 *      The range CFAR algorithm could be replaced by a more sophisticated algorithm like CFAR-OS 
 *      to get the benefit of this way of processing.
 *    @subsubsection scaling Scaling
 *      Most of the signal processing in the data path that happens in real-time in 1D and 2D processing
 *      uses fixed-point arithmetic (versus floating point arithmetic). While the C647X is natively capable
 *      of both fixed and floating, the choice here is more for MIPS optimality but using fixed-point requires
 *      some considerations for preventing underflow and overflow while maintaining the desired accuracy
 *      required for correct functionality. 
 *      - 1D processing: If the input to the FFT were a pure tone at one of the bins, then 
 *      the output magnitude of the FFT at that bin will be \f$N / \lceil2^{log_4(N)-1}\rceil\f$ (\f$N\f$ is the FFT order) times
 *      the input tone amplitude (because tone is complex, this implies that the individual real and 
 *      imaginary components will also be amplified by a maximum of this scale). 
 *      Because we do a Hanning window before the FFT, the overall scale is 1/2 of the FFT scale.
 *      This means for example for 256 point FFT, the windowing + FFT scale will be 16. 
 *      Therefore, the ADC output when it is a pure tone should not exceed +/-2^15/16 = 2048 for
 *      the I and Q components. The XWR16xx EVM when presented with a strong single reflector
 *      reasonably close to it (with Rx dB gain of 30 dB in the chirp profile) 
 *      shows ADC samples to be a max of about 3000 and while this exceeds
 *      the 2048 maximum, is not a pure tone, the energy of the FFT is seen in other bins
 *      also and the solution still works well and detects the strong object.
 *      - 2D processing: For the 2D FFT, given that the input is the output of 1D FFT that
 *      can amplify its input as mentioned in previous section, it is more appropriate to use
 *      a 32x32 FFT which helps prevent overflow and reduce quantization noise of the FFT.
 *
 *    @subsubsection edma EDMA versus Cache based Processing
 *      The C647X has L1D cache which is enabled and processing can be done without using EDMA
 *      to access the L2 SRAM and L3 memories through cache. However, the latency to L3 RAM
 *      is much more than L2SRAM and this causes cycle waits that are avoided by using EDMA
 *      to prefetch or postcommit the data into L2SRAM. The L1D is configured part cache (16 KB)
 *      and part SRAM (16 KB). Presently the L3 RAM is not declared as cacheable
 *      (i.e the MAR register settings are defaulted to no caching for L3 RAM).
 *      Various buffers involved in data path processing are placed in
 *      L1SRAM and L2SRAM in a way to optimize memory usage by overlaying between and within 1D, 2D
 *      and 3D processing stages. The overlay choices are based on a variety
 *      of configurations that this demo supports, so the choice may not necessarily
 *      be optimal for a specific/known configuration.
 *      The overlays are documented in the comments in the body of the
 *      function @ref MmwDemo_dataPathConfigBuffers
 *      and can be disabled using a compile time flag for debug purposes. The function
 *      uses a macro @ref MMW_ALLOC_BUF to facilitate expressing the cascading and
 *      parallelization of buffers. It creates a local variable \<name\>_end automatically
 *      to be used for subsequent cascaded allocation.
 *      Figure below also documents the same overlay scheme. The figure is not to scale as
 *      actual sizes will vary based on configuration.
 *

 *
 *  @subsection LVDSStreamingNotes Streaming data over LVDS
 *    The LVDS streaming feature enables the streaming of HW data (a combination of ADC/CP/CQ data)
 *    and/or user specific SW data through LVDS interface.
 *    The streaming is done mostly by the CBUFF and EDMA peripherals with minimal CPU intervention. 
 *    The streaming is configured through the lvdsStreamCfg CLI command. 
 *    The LVDS streaming configuration includes the following 3 items:\n\n
 *    a) Enable/Disable HSI header. This controls if HSI header is enabled or disabled for all active streams 
 *    (HW and/or SW). Note that if SW stream is enabled HSI header must be enabled.\n\n
 *    b) HW streaming data format. This controls which type of HW data will be streamed (ADC/CP/CQ).
 *    The following values are allowed for this field\n
 *    0 - HW streaming disabled\n
 *    1 - ADC data streamed\n
 *    2 - CP_ADC data streamed\n
 *    3 - ADC_CP data streamed\n
 *    4 - CP_ADC_CQ data streamed\n\n
 *    c) Enable/Disable SW streaming.\n\n
 *    When HW data LVDS streaming is enabled the ADC/CP/CQ data is streamed per chirp as soon as the data is available
 *    in the HW buffers. When SW data streaming is enabled, it is streamed during inter frame processing after the list of detected objects for that frame is computed.
 *    The SW data streamed is composed of 3 blocks:\n 
 *    i) HSI header (@ref HSIHeader_t): refer to HSI module for details.\n
 *    ii) User data header: contains the frame number, number of detected objects and 2 reserved bytes @ref MmwDemo_LVDSUserDataHeader \n
 *    iii) List of detected objects in that frame (one instance of @ref MmwDemo_detectedObj_t per detected object).\n\n 
 *    The format of the SW data streamed is shown in the following figure:
 *      
 *      @image html lvds_sw_data_format.png "LVDS SW Data format"
 *
 *    The following figure shows a timing diagram for the LVDS streaming (the figure is not to scale as actual durations will vary based on configuration).

 *
 *    Note on L3 memory and overlay
 *    ------------------------------
 *    A quick look at the L3_SRAM column will show that the total of that column exceeds the total 
 *    physical memory available on the device. The reason is that we use the code-data overlay mechanism
 *    to virtually extend the available memory on the device. One-time startup code is overlaid with the 
 *    radar cube. At startup, the application code accesses these functions to perform one-time setup functionality. 
 *    Beyond that point, application code does not have a need to access these functions again and hence switches 
 *    to access radarCube placed at the exact same location. Refer to the linker command file of the demo on the 
 *    mechanics of this overlay technique.
 *
 *    L1P/L3 overlay in 16xx DSS
 *    ---------------------------
 *    Currently bootloader does not allow loading in L1PSRAM and hence we use the overlay and copy table functionality 
 *    of the linker to specify the load address as L3_SRAM but run address as L1P_SRAM for some of the functions that 
 *    have time-critical operations (for e.g., mmWaveLib functions). In the table we show such functions as placed
 *    in L1P_SRAM and do not show it under L3_SRAM column since the startup code takes care of copying from L3_SRAM and 
 *    placing it in L1P_SRAM and that memory in L3_SRAM is available for use for other purposes.
