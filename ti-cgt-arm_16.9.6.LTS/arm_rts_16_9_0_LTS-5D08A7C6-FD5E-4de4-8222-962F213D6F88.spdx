DocumentComment: <text>About This SPDX Manifest: TI is using this SPDX document as an industry-standardized manifest for TI customers.  TI believes these standardized manifests will enable TI customers to more easily integrate multiple manifests from their suppliers into the comprehensive manifest they are supplying to their customers. Please recognize that while TI has done some initial review of the information for accuracy, no manifest is perfect and  it is possible that something may be missed.  It is also important to note that the SHA1 values for the files may not be the final checksums, even though we have reviewed the copyright and license information.  
About SPDX: SPDX is an industry working group that is working on an ongoing basis to develop and improve a standard method for the exchange of licensing information (see http://spdx.org).  TI is participating in this working group in order to (i) provide the industry with an overall improvement in the quality and consistency of manifests, and (ii) give suppliers and customers a firm foundation on which to build and constantly improve their manifests.  Please note that SPDX is an evolving standard and, therefore, SPDX manifests you receive from TI and other suppliers in the future may not be exactly the same, but will show improvements in quality and ease of use.

/* exp(x)
* Returns the exponential of x.
*
* Method
*   1. Argument reduction:
*      Reduce x to an r so that |r| <= 0.5*ln2 ~ 0.34658.
*	Given x, find r and integer k such that
*
*               x = k*ln2 + r,  |r| <= 0.5*ln2.
*
*      Here r will be represented as r = hi-lo for better
*	accuracy.
*
*   2. Approximation of exp(r) by a special rational function on
*	the interval [0,0.34658]:
*	Write
*	    R(r**2) = r*(exp(r)+1)/(exp(r)-1) = 2 + r*r/6 - r**4/360 + ...
*      We use a special Remes algorithm on [0,0.34658] to generate
* 	a polynomial of degree 5 to approximate R. The maximum error
*	of this polynomial approximation is bounded by 2**-59. In
*	other words,
*	    R(z) ~ 2.0 + P1*z + P2*z**2 + P3*z**3 + P4*z**4 + P5*z**5
*  	(where z=r*r, and the values of P1 to P5 are listed below)
*	and
*	    |                  5          |     -59
*	    | 2.0+P1*z+...+P5*z   -  R(z) | <= 2
*	    |                             |
*	The computation of exp(r) thus becomes
*                             2*r
*		exp(r) = 1 + -------
*		              R - r
*                                 r*R1(r)
*		       = 1 + r + ----------- (for better accuracy)

/* hypot(x,y)
*
* Method :
*	If (assume round-to-nearest) z=x*x+y*y
*	has error less than sqrt(2)/2 ulp, than
*	sqrt(z) has error less than 1 ulp (exercise).
*
*	So, compute sqrt(x*x+y*y) with some care as
*	follows to get the error below 1 ulp:
*
*	Assume x>y>0;
*	(if possible, set rounding to round-to-nearest)
*	1. if x > 2y  use
*		x1*x1+(y*y+(x2*(x+x1))) for x*x+y*y
*	where x1 = x with lower 32 bits cleared, x2 = x-x1; else

*	where t1 = 2x with lower 32 bits cleared, t2 = 2x-t1,
*	y1= y with lower 32 bits chopped, y2 = y-y1.
*
*	NOTE: scaling may be necessary if some argument is too

/* lgamma_r(x, signgamp)
* Reentrant version of the logarithm of the Gamma function
* with user provide pointer for the sign of Gamma(x).
*
* Method:
*   1. Argument Reduction for 0 < x <= 8
* 	Since gamma(1+s)=s*gamma(s), for x in [0,8], we may
* 	reduce x to a number in [1.5,2.5] by
* 		lgamma(1+s) = log(s) + lgamma(s)
*	for example,
*		lgamma(7.3) = log(6.3) + lgamma(6.3)
*			    = log(6.3*5.3) + lgamma(5.3)
*			    = log(6.3*5.3*4.3*3.3*2.3) + lgamma(2.3)
*   2. Polynomial approximation of lgamma around its
*	minimun ymin=1.461632144968362245 to maintain monotonicity.
*	On [ymin-0.23, ymin+0.27] (i.e., [1.23164,1.73163]), use
*		Let z = x-ymin;
*		lgamma(x) = -1.214862905358496078218 + z^2*poly(z)
*	where
*		poly(z) is a 14 degree polynomial.
*   2. Rational approximation in the primary interval [2,3]
*	We use the following approximation:
*		s = x-2.0;
*		lgamma(x) = 0.5*s + s*P(s)/Q(s)
*	with accuracy
*		|P/Q - (lgamma(x)-0.5s)| < 2**-61.71
*	Our algorithms are based on the following observation
*
*                             zeta(2)-1    2    zeta(3)-1    3
* lgamma(2+s) = s*(1-Euler) + --------- * s  -  --------- * s  + ...

*           ------------------------------------------
*	     |  Use the hardware sqrt if you have one |
*           ------------------------------------------
* Method:
*   Bit by bit method using integer arithmetic. (Slow, but portable)
*   1. Normalization
*	Scale x to y in [1,4) with even powers of 2:
*	find an integer k such that  1 <= (y=x*2^(2k)) < 4, then
*		sqrt(x) = 2^k * sqrt(y)
*   2. Bit by bit computation
*	Let q  = sqrt(y) truncated to i bit after binary point (q = 1),
*	     i							 0
*                                     i+1         2
*	    s  = 2*q , and	y  =  2   * ( y - q  ).		(1)
*	     i      i            i                 i
*
*	To compute q    from q , one checks whether
*		    i+1       i
*
*			      -(i+1) 2
*			(q + 2      ) <= y.			(2)
*     			  i
*							      -(i+1)
*	If (2) is false, then q   = q ; otherwise q   = q  + 2      .
*		 	       i+1   i             i+1   i
*
*	With some algebric manipulation, it is not difficult to see
*	that (2) is equivalent to
*                             -(i+1)
*			s  +  2       <= y			(3)
