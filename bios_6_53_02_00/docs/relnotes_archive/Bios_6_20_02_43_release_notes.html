users are recommended to use f28335dspbios.gel file supplied with CCSv4
to connect and load any BIOS example programs that require external
memory.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">The enhancements are listed in the particular DSP/BIOS 6.x release
in which they occurred:</p><h3><b><b style="">DSP/BIOS&nbsp;</b></b>6.20</h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Devices:&nbsp; </span>DSP/BIOS
6.20 adds support for the C28x family of devices. &nbsp;A number of
other devices have been added for devices that have been released since
6.10. &nbsp;Check the on-line documentation for the 'ti.sysbios.family'
package to see a full list of supported devices.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>New Compiler Models: </span>&nbsp;Added
support for 674x and 64x+ ELF compiler/linker&nbsp;using compiler
pre-release (v7.0.0A). &nbsp;Added support for Arm9 and Cortex-M3 model
using compiler pre-release (v4.6.0A).<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br><br>Runtime Object View (ROV) Real Time Analysis (RTA): </span>&nbsp;Many improvements in usability and stability since 6.10.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br><br>Graphical Configuration (xgconf):</span>

plugin.&nbsp; The ROV plugin is a smart memory window that provides
nicely formatted state data for the assorted DSP/BIOS modules and
objects.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br><br>Real Time Analysis (RTA): </span>DSP/BIOS
6.10 contains a new ti.sysbios.rta package which is used to communicate
with and send Log data to CCSv4 analysis plugins.&nbsp; This first
release only supports RTDX as the transport, but the architecture is
very open and will support other transports (like UART or TCP/IP) in
the future.&nbsp; CCSv4 is currently an early adopter product --
changes and improvements willl be made to the RTA plugins before the
CCSv4 beta and final releases.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br><br>Graphical Configuration (xgconf):</span>
The RTSC graphical configuration tool can be used to view and update a
DSP/BIOS configuration. A alpha release of xgconf is provided with XDC tools release.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">I/O Support:</span>

Benchmarks are now provided for the supported targets.&nbsp; These are
provided in the ti.sysbios.benchmarks package.&nbsp; The benchmarks are
described in an appendix to the DSP/BIOS User's Guide.&nbsp; Results
are provided with the product.&nbsp; See&nbsp;<a href="#Benchmarks">Benchmarks</a>.<br>&nbsp;<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Improved BIOS 5.x Legacy Support:</span>&nbsp;
A number of legacy APIs have been fixed or improved.&nbsp; The
ti.bios.conversion tool has had some improvements.&nbsp; A new app
note&nbsp;<a href="#Documentation_Links">Document</a> "Migrating a DSP/BIOS 5 Application to DSP/BIOS 6" is now provided.<br>&nbsp;<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Arm Thumb Mode Support:</span>&nbsp; Thumb mode libraries are now provided for the Arm9 target.<br>&nbsp;<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bug Fixes and Maintenance:</span>&nbsp; A number of bugs and minor enhancements are included including support for some new devices (e.g., DM510).<br><br><h3><o:p></o:p><b style="">DSP/BIOS 6.00<o:p></o:p></b></h3><b style="">Event Module:</b> The
Event module enables a task to wait on multiple events. The Event module
supports up to 32 events (16 for devices with 16-bit integers), which can be any AND or OR combination of custom
user-defined events, I/O events, or a semaphore, message queue, or mailbox post.<br><o:p></o:p><b style=""><br>Priority-Inheritance Gate:</b>
Priority-inheritance gates automatically resolve priority-inversion, making it
safer to share resources between high-priority and low-priority tasks. <br><o:p></o:p><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><br>Memory
Manager:</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> DSP/BIOS utilizes the memory manager that comes
with the XDC run-time. This memory manager allows for the concept of multiple,
concurrent heaps and enables users to easily add their own custom heaps for
performance or debug purposes. See the <i style="">XDC
Consumer User&#8217;s Guide</i>, section 4.5 for further details. &nbsp;DSP/BIOS provides
three heap implementations that may be used </span>with this manager: HeapMem and HeapBuf, which correspond to
the MEM and BUF modules from earlier DSP/BIOS releases and HeapMultiBuf, which
provides a faster, more deterministic multiple-pool based-heap whose
performance does not degrade with fragmentation.<br><o:p></o:p><b style=""><br>HWI and SWI Hooks:</b>
There are now hook functions available for both hardware interrupts (HWIs) and
software interrupts (SWIs) as well as tasks. If these hooks are not selected
during configuration, there is not additional overhead incurred.<br><o:p></o:p><b style=""><br>Greater Number of Priority Levels:</b> The number of priority levels for both tasks and software
interrupts is now configurable and has been increased to up to 32 levels for
each (16 for devices with 16-bit integers).<br><o:p></o:p><b style=""><br>Dynamic and static
creation for all objects:</b> All objects may now be created both dynamically
and statically<br><o:p></o:p><b style=""><br>Support for ARM926
core:</b> DSP/BIOS now includes libraries for some ARM926-based devices. Both
Thumb and 32-bit mode libraries are provided.<br><o:p></o:p><b style=""><br>DSP/BIOS APIs have
standardized error handling:</b> All DSP/BIOS system calls that can fail, such
as object creation calls, now have a standardized way of returning errors using
the XDC error module. This error-block-based approach has significant
advantages compared to using return codes, including having all errors pass
through a single point and ensuring that an error handler can be called without
having to explicitly check a return code. See the <i style="">XDC Consumer User&#8217;s Guide</i> for further details.<br><o:p></o:p><b style=""><br>DSP/BIOS APIs have
parameter checking:</b> DSP/BIOS APIs can now be configured to have built-in
debug asserts that are raised, for example, if an invalid task priority level
is passed as a parameter. For further information on the behavior of Asserts,
See the <i style="">XDC Consumer User&#8217;s Guide</i> for further details.<br><o:p></o:p><b style=""><br>DSP/BIOS functions
are placed in individual subsections:</b> Each DSP/BIOS function is now placed
in a subsection named .text:&lt;DSP/BIOS API Name&gt;. This makes it simple to
locate different parts of DSP/BIOS in different areas of memory.<br><o:p></o:p><b style=""><br>BIOS Emulation
library for Windows:</b> The DSP/BIOS emulation library for Windows enables
DSP/BIOS systems calls and multithreading behavior to be used in a Windows
application. This capability allows much more comprehensive prototyping of DSP
applications in a Windows desktop environment, in which developers can use
software debug and test tools not available for an embedded target.<br><h4>Defects Fixed since DSP/BIOS 6.20:</h4>SDOCM00061541 - add TCI6488 and 6472 support to ti.sysbios.family.c64p and timer packages<br>SDOCM00061539 - update Arm to 4.6.0B1 and 6x/ELF and 6x/Tesla/COFF to 7.0.0B1<br>SDOCM00061537 - Incorrect interrupt masking in HSRTDX for RtdxModule used by DSP/BIOS 6.x<br><br><ul>

<h2><a name="Upgrading_And_Compatibility_Info">Upgrading and Compatibility Information</a></h2>DSP/BIOS 6.x releases have many significant changes from
DSP/BIOS 5.x. &nbsp;It is important to understand the information below in order to
successfully use DSP/BIOS 6.x and to migrate applications from DSP/BIOS 5.x.



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><b style="">DA830 ROM<o:p></o:p></b>

</p><p class="MsoNormal">BIOS 6.20 is 100% compatible with the DA830
ROM. &nbsp;A couple minor bug fixes to code in the ROM are worked
around with jump-table patches in the ROM. &nbsp;This jump table
patching is handled by the updated 'ti.sysbios.rom.da830' ROM package.
&nbsp;No changes to the application are necessary other than rebuild
with new packages.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b style="">The 'ti.sdo.io' and 'ti.sdo.utils' packages are no longer provided with DSP/BIOS<o:p></o:p></b>

</p><p class="MsoNormal">These packages are now provided in a separate
"IPC" product. &nbsp;Users of these packages simply need to add this
other product directory to their package path (XDCPATH) to build their
applications.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b style="">DSP/BIOS no longer
contains all the tools and objects you will need<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The XDC tools now provide the DSP/BIOS configuration tools and Platform support.
XDC also includes a minimal run-time environment that provides the LOG, System,
Asserts, Error handling, Timestamp, and Memory Allocation APIs that will be
used by DSP/BIOS applications. &nbsp;Please refer to the <i style="">Getting Started Guide</i> on where to download the XDC tools and
run-time.</p>



<o:p></o:p><b style="">Migrating DSP/BIOS
5.x applications to DSP/BIOS 6.x<o:p></o:p></b>

<p class="MsoNormal">DSP/BIOS 6.x has different APIs compared to those in
DSP/BIOS 5.x. Configuration scripts are also incompatible between the two
releases. &nbsp;To provide easy migration of DSP/BIOS 5.x applications, an API
compatibility layer is provided along with a conversion tool that converts
configuration scripts to work with XDC and DSP/BIOS 6.x. &nbsp;The API compatibility
layer provides 100% C source code compatibility with the exception of a few
APIs that are no longer supported. &nbsp;For more complete details of migrating
DSP/BIOS 5.x applications and configuration scripts, please refer to&nbsp;<a href="docs/Bios_Legacy_App_Note.pdf">Migrating a DSP/BIOS 5 Application to DSP/BIOS 6</a><i style="">.</i></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>As mentioned above, some APIs previously supported in
DSP/BIOS 5.x releases will no longer be supported in this release or the
compatibility layer. &nbsp;Complete details are provided in the Migration document referenced
above.</p><a href="#BIOS_TOP">back to top</a>
