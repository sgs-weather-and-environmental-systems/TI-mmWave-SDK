 *  thereby preventing accidental consumption of a package with
 *  an inappropriate version of the XDCtools.
 *
 *  Note that the MSRP for this package is not necessarily
 *  correlated with the external version of the XDCtools (eg., 3.10.15),
 *  but is used to strictly communicate overall compatibility between
 *  versions of the XDCtools.
